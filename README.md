# hello-world
Description:
This is my *new* repository for my Marcy Lab assignment about Github features on how to make a **repository**, make a new **branch**, editing in the **markdown** file, and execute **pull requests**.

A little about myself:
I am a full blooded Ecuadorian (or as I am told anyways -_-) I can speak, write, and understand Spanish. I am 20 years *young*, and I am a Spring-2023 fellow at the **Marcy Lab School** starting my software engineer journey. As it stands at the moment, I have coded with `Javascript` and navigated around the `Command Line Interface`. It is only first week in however, I am trying to build great habits everyday that will advance my learning in computer programming. The motto is **1% better** everyday. 
As far hobbies go, I am an avid anime watcher, I like going to gym (as long as its early in the day), cycling with friends - especially around manhattan with no destination, and I like to play/watch video games; mostly valorant. Here is a picture of my favorite character called Kirito from sword art online:
